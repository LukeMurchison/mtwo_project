The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals, birds, and rodents. It can leap higher than 3.0 m (10 ft) and catch birds in midair. It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m (16 ft) of it, after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck.', '5,000,000'),

Primary food sources are ungulates, particularly deer, but it also hunts smaller prey such as rodents. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but also lives in open areas. Cougars are territorial and lives at low population densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey.', '30,000'),
